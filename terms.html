    <p>You acknowledge that Ideanator cannot guarantee the security of any data you disclose online.

We will attempt to resolve the dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before either party initiates arbitration.</p>
    <p><strong>13.2 Binding Arbitration:</strong> If informal resolution fails, any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved through binding arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in English and the seat of arbitration shall be in Delaware, United States.</p>
    <p><strong>13.3 Class Action Waiver:</strong> YOU AND IDEANATOR AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. You expressly waive any right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.</p>
    <p><strong>13.4 Exception:</strong> Notwithstanding the above, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.</p>
    
    <h2>14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>These Terms and your use of the Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any legal action or proceeding not subject to arbitration shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Delaware, and you hereby consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>
    <p>If you are accessing the Service from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction.</p>
    
    <h2>15. International Use and Export Controls</h2>
    <p>The Service is controlled and operated from the United States. Ideanator makes no representation that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations.

    <h2>16. Modifications to Terms</h2>
    <p>Ideanator reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time in our sole discretion. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email (if you have provided one) or by posting a notice on the Service at least thirty (30) days before the changes take effect.</p>
    <p>Your continued use of the Service after any modifications constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must stop using the Service immediately.</p>
    <p>We will indicate the "Last Modified" date at the top of these Terms. You are responsible for regularly reviewing these Terms to stay informed of updates.</p>
    
    <h2>17. Severability and Waiver</h2>
    <p><strong>17.1 Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
    <p><strong>17.2 Waiver:</strong> No waiver of any term or condition of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. Any failure to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
    
    <h2>18. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>Ideanator shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance under these Terms arising out of or caused by acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, pandemic, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor, or materials, or any other circumstances beyond our reasonable control.</p>
    
    <h2>19. Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any other legal notices or agreements published by us on the Service, constitute the entire agreement between you and Ideanator concerning the Service. These Terms supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations, warranties, and understandings with respect to the Service, whether written or oral.</p>
    
    <h2>20. Assignment</h2>
    <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms or any rights or obligations hereunder without Ideanator's prior written consent. Ideanator may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.</p>
    
    <h2>21. No Third-Party Beneficiaries</h2>
    <p>These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than you and Ideanator. No third party shall have any rights to enforce any provision of these Terms.</p>
    
    <h2>22. Electronic Communications and Signatures</h2>
